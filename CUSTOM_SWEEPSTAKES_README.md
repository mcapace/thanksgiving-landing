## üìä Entry Management

### Current Storage
Entries are currently stored **in-memory** using the system in `lib/sweepstakes-entries.ts`. This works for development and testing.

### For Production
You'll want to upgrade to a real database. Recommended options:

#### Option 1: Vercel Postgres (Easiest)
```bash
# Install Vercel Postgres
npm install @vercel/postgres

# Add database URL to environment variables
# POSTGRES_URL=postgres://...
```

#### Option 2: Supabase (Free tier available)
```bash
# Install Supabase
npm install @supabase/supabase-js

# Add Supabase credentials to environment variables
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
```

#### Option 3: MongoDB (Flexible)
```bash
# Install MongoDB
npm install mongodb

# Add MongoDB connection string
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
```

### Accessing Entries

The current system tracks:
- Entry count
- Duplicate email detection
- All entry information (name, email, phone, address, etc.)
- Entry timestamp
- IP address (for fraud prevention)

To export entries for winner selection:
```typescript
import { getAllEntries, exportEntriesToCSV } from '@/lib/sweepstakes-entries';

// Get all entries as array
const entries = getAllEntries();

// Export to CSV format
const csv = exportEntriesToCSV();
```
